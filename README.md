================
Visual C++ example projects to demonstrate the building blocks of software modulization using [*Poco C++ libraries*](https://pocoproject.org/).

Prerequisites
-------------
- ***Poco C++ libraries*** version 1.7.6

All projects here rely on the integration environment of [*vcpkg*](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) ports. Use of *vcpkg* is recommended for a quick start. Otherwise, it is necessary to modify the project settings for your own development environment.
 
Overview of The Examples
------------------------
- *AppLoadPlugin*: How a feature-rich application framework can provide without writing too many codes.
- *TaskStateControl*: Tasks and states coordinating in a higher level way.
- *MessageLink*: //TODO
