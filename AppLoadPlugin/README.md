AppLoadPlugin
-------------

This example is modified from [Poco](http://pocoproject.org/)'s "SampleApp" project. It demonstrates how elegant it is to construct a feature-rich application using the *config*, *logger*, and command line *defineOptions* methods that are wrapped in **Application** class. For modulization, this project shows how to load class from plugin using **ClassLoader** template and different class can be loaded according to different configuration.
